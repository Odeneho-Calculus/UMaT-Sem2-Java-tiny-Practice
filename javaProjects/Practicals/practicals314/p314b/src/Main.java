/*
 * Explanation:
 * 1. The program calculates and displays the natural log and square roots of given numbers.
 * 2. Math.log() is used to calculate the natural logarithm of 45.
 * 3. Math.sqrt() is used to calculate the square root of 29 and 65.
 * 4. The results are displayed to the user using System.out.println().
 *
 * To run the program:
 * 1. Save the code in a file named Main.java.
 * 2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
 * 3. Compile the program by running the command: javac Main.java
 * 4. Run the compiled program with the command: java Main
 * 5. See the calculated values of natural log and square roots displayed.

/*
 * Explanation:
 * 1. The program performs division of 2 by 6 with explicit casting to double for a precise result.
 * 2. The result is stored in the 'result' variable.
 * 3. System.out.printf() is used to display the result with two decimal places.
 *
 * To run the program:
 * 1. Save the code in a file named Division.java.
 * 2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
 * 3. Compile the program by running the command: javac Division.java
 * 4. Run the compiled program with the command: java Division
 * 5. See the result of the division displayed with two decimal places.
